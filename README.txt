This project is a software application designed to assist users in identifying medicines. It leverages image processing and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with Tesseract to extract text from uploaded images of medicine labels. The application utilizes an SQLite database for efficient storage and retrieval of medicine details, replacing the dependency on JSON files. A user-friendly graphical interface enables users to upload images, extract text, and match it with database records. Voice assistance is provided through gTTS, reading aloud the medicine name and relevant details for improved accessibility. Furthermore, the application includes a reminder setting feature, allowing users to schedule notifications for medication intake, ensuring adherence to prescribed schedules.
