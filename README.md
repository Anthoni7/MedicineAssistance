# MedicineAssistance
Welcome to my Python project repository! This project showcases innovative solutions and efficient code for various challenges. Dive in to explore, learn, and contribute.


This project is a software application designed to assist users in identifying medicines 💊. It leverages image processing 📸 and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with Tesseract to extract text from uploaded images of medicine labels. The application utilizes an SQLite database 💾 for efficient storage and retrieval of medicine details, replacing the dependency on JSON files. A user-friendly graphical interface 🖥️ enables users to upload images, extract text, and match it with database records. Voice assistance 🗣️ is provided through gTTS, reading aloud the medicine name and relevant details for improved accessibility. Furthermore, the application includes a reminder setting feature ⏰, allowing users to schedule notifications for medication intake, ensuring adherence to prescribed schedules.
